## Proactive Road Safety: A Hybrid Machine Learning Model 

## Description
This project focuses on the development of a predictive system for analyzing road accidents, their 
contributing factors, and the severity of those accidents. By leveraging advanced machine learning 
techniques, specifically Random Forest and Time Series Analysis, the study aims to predict both the 
occurrence and severity of accidents on an hourly and weekly basis. The system will analyze historical data 
on road accidents, traffic patterns, weather conditions, and other relevant variables to provide accurate 
forecasts. These predictions will enable proactive measures to improve road safety, reduce accident rates, 
and anticipate the severity of accidents. This approach will contribute to enhancing emergency response 
strategies, optimizing infrastructure planning, and preventing future accidents through data-driven insights.
